# Data Engineer Journey

This repository documents my journey from absolute beginner
to world class Data Engineer in New York.

This is a hands-on, project-driven path focused on building
real data systems — not just learning theory.

## What I’m Building Skills In
- Python for data processing and automation
- SQL and database design (OLTP & OLAP)
- Data pipelines (ETL / ELT)
- Data modeling and warehousing
- APIs and data ingestion
- Workflow orchestration and scheduling
- Cloud platforms (AWS)
- Big data tools (Spark)
- Version control and engineering best practices

## Project Philosophy
Each project in this repository represents a real-world
data engineering problem, increasing in complexity over time.
Projects are designed to be production-inspired, not toy examples.

## Repository Structure (evolves with projects)
- python/        → Data processing, scripts, and pipelines
- sql/           → Queries, schemas, and database projects
- pipelines/     → End-to-end ETL / ELT workflows
- cloud/         → Cloud infrastructure and services
- notes/         → Concepts, explanations, and design decisions
